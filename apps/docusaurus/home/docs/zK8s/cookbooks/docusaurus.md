# Docusaurus #

#### ```apps/docusaurus ```

Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation,
leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features
but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

#### ```cookbooks/docusaurus ```

Contains full Kubernetes infra setup for Docusaurus, which is the site generator used to build our docs site. Which you
can deploy on our platform via UI, API, or any place that supports Kubernetes.

#### ```docker/docusaurus ```

You can use this docker setup as a template to build your own docusaurus site.
