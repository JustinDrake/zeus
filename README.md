Documentation and code examples are found here
[API_README.md](https://github.com/zeus-fyi/zeus/blob/main/pkg/zeus/API_README.md)

How to use the test suite to setup your own api calls
[README.md](https://github.com/zeus-fyi/zeus/blob/main/pkg/zeus/README.md)

The test directory contains useful mocks and tools for interacting with the API. It also contains a useful
config-sample.yaml, convert this to config.yaml and set your bearer token here, which then allows you to
use the demo code to create your first api request in seconds

### Hera Client

This client uses the OpenAI API to generate code with AI. This service is available at OpenAI cost, so just pay for the token cost, otherwise it is free to use.

### Hades Library

Hades is used to interact with Kubernetes workloads via API, and can apply saved Zeus workloads & cookbooks onto your own in house infrastructure.

## Cookbooks ##

Contains common web2 & web3 building components like ethereum infra setups with customization driven through code, blurring the line between infra configuration and app development, and contains microservice designs & patterns like api servers and injectable choreography, their setups in Kubernetes, Golang, Docker, and startup commands, and useful tools for debugging, interacting, and automating actions.

### Cookbook Structure ###

#### Microservice Template Recipes ###

Contains full Kubernetes infra setup templates for microservices, simulating loads, injectable choreography for clusters, and more continually being added.

#### ```cookbooks/microservices/choreography ```
#### ```cookbooks/microservices/deployments ```
#### ```cookbooks/microservices/load_simulator ```

#### Redis ###

#### ```zeus/cookbooks/redis ```

Contains full Kubernetes infra setup for open source BSD 3-Clause version of Redis with one master, two replicas, and including t-digest integration. You can find the pre-built bundle on our Docker repo: zeusfyi/redis:latest 

### Web3 Cookbook 

### Artemis ###

#### ```artemis.zeus.fyi``` ####
#### ```pkg/artemis/client```

Our web3 Artemis client is a tx orchestrator. It reliably submits & confirms ethereum transactions and logs their receipts. Chain with 
the in memory db for storing web3 signer keys to build highly reliable web3 api actions with other users and smart contracts. You'll need
a bearer token to use this client. A more advanced orchestrator that can handle high volume DeFi trading & simulation, which manages nonce sequences, sets up event triggers & scheduling, and has queriable event artifacts is available only via enterprise licensing or other pre-arranged agreements at the moment.

### Hercules ###

#### ```apps/hercules``` ####
#### ```pkg/hercules/client```

Hercules is middleware that manages web infrastructure and connections to other middleware packages. It also contains useful apis to debug and troubleshoot web infrastructure.

### Snapshots ###

#### ```apps/snapshots``` ####

Snapshot app is embedded into the hercules docker app, and it can be used as an init container to download snapshot data on new node creation.

#### Ethereum ####

#### ```protocol/components```

Contains smart contract automation kits. This testcase shows a full end-end seed, create, and deposits validators on the Ethereum ephemery testnet.

#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/automation```
#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/automation/deposits_test.go ```

Cookbook items listed by protocol & component class. Eg. Ethereum has a beacon component group. Contains Kubernetes config setup templates. Here's a few example paths. Also contains an actions folder, which does log dumps, pod restarts, configuration changes on demand for k8s applications, and more.

#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/beacons/infra/consensus_client```
#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/beacons/infra/exec_client```
#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/validators/infra/validators```
#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/web3signers/infra/consensys_web3signer```

Complete, and powerful Ethereum infra automation 

#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/beacons/beacon_cluster_test.go ```
#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/validators/validator_cluster_test.go ```
#### ```cookbooks/ethereum/web3signers/web3signer_cluster_test.go ```

See this test case to see how a beacon cluster class was created, and then extended to support choreography to reset configs on a scheduled interval for the Ephemery testnet, and then added validator clients, and then again to add web3signing integration.

## Infra configuration is in the 14th century. Introducing the 21st century printing press. Advil optional, finally.

We've merged Kubernetes & Temporal orchestration and added state management using a relational database to manage distributed infra setups. We exposed control of this system orchestrator to an SDK and UI that allows you to glue sophisticated distributed systems together in a fraction of the time it took previously which lets you focus on research and product development instead of figuring out how to build a distributed system or understand Kubernetes.

### Overview 

1. Automates translation of kubernetes yaml configurations into representative SQL models
2. Users upload these infrastructure configurations via API where they are stored in the DB
3. Users can then query the contents of these infrastructure components, deploy, mutate or destroy them on demand
   
### Currently Supported Workload Types

1. Deployments
2. StatefulSets
3. Services
4. ConfigMaps
5. Ingresses
6. ServiceMonitors
7. Secrets

+ Node Tainting Automation & Infra Provisioning (Servers & SSDs) Deployable & Scalable on Demand.

### Pods Controller 

1. GetPods
2. GetPodLogs
3. PortforwardReqToPods
4. DeletePods

### Cluster Topology Class Hierarchy Definitions ###

### Highest to Lowest Level &# Deployable Topologies ###

### Network Orchestration Topology ###

One or many network matrix system topologies that are combined with orchestration workflows from Artemis, and Zeus, to build complex control flows and/or sequenced network states. This could be an enterprise fleet of infrastructure, a complex devops operation done at scale, or a built-in orchestration flow for automating maintenance procedures & service restoration and sending them notifications and prompts.

At this stage you can manage complex topologies of infrastructure at the highest of scale over numerous regions and cloud providers, and include workflow hooks & event triggers, and long running control loops and batch processes. Which lets you control your environment on demand with complete automation.

### Matrix Topology ###

A multi-component cluster topology that accomplishes one or more system components on its own and combined with a Zeus injection deploys this topology onto the network. Some but not all of these topologies can be stacked with another cluster topology or a base topology to create a higher level system component.

It can be any combination of lower level system topologies or components. At this stage you can now include server resource requirements & tainting rules.

### Cluster Topology ###

A fully working single component cluster topology that accomplishes one system component on its own and combined with a Zeus injection deploys this topology onto the network. Some but not all of these topologies can be stacked with another cluster topology or a base topology to create a higher level system component.

### Deployable but Incomplete Topologies ###

### Base Topology ###

A fully working single cluster topology that needs at least one other Base Topology to create a higher level component. An example would be deploying an execution client by itself post-merge on ethereum. It would be able to download chain data, but it wouldnâ€™t be able to fulfill a useful purpose without another piece e.g. a consensus client component.  

Not deployable on its own, a mix of these is combined to create a deployable topology

### Infrastructure Base ###
An abstract atomic infrastructure base that needs a Skeleton and Configuration to create a Base Topology

### Configuration Base ###
An abstract atomic configuration base that needs an Infrastructure Base and Skeleton to create a Base Topology

### Skeleton Base ###
An abstract atomic component base that needs additional pieces to create deployable infrastructure like config map, docker image links, etc. Needs an Infrastructure and Configuration Base to create a Base Topology

## Zeus ##

Weâ€™ve built technology significantly improving Kubernetes in both scalability and usability enabling you to automate complex devops procedures, schedule resource management allocations, design cost performant applications, and manage distributed cloud infra setups at scale with far less effort and with almost zero knowledge of Kubernetes needed so you can reduce your engineering time managing infra and spend that time on research and product development instead. 

We built an orchestration engine using Temporal over Kubernetes itself for managing, and controlling infrastructure which lets you automate deployments without GitOps and the complex operator installments needed for each cloud provider that comes with them, and mapped all the infrastructure configuration into our Postgres database, saving you from managing Helm charts with hundreds of obscure conditionals in templated YAML. Since we also store all the cloud provider infra data and manage the API for provisioning it lets us prefilter relevant servers for your applications that saves you time from having to research or keep track of the hundreds of machines types each cloud provider offers and lets you preview the expected cost of deployment. This also means you need zero Terraform, saving you immense amount of time from managing hundreds of pages of brittle pseudo infra as code languages in your Git repos.

This also makes the entire infrastructure layout completely searchable and controllable on demand through automated tagging for node taints and pod affinity requests, making it easily mappable to business logic requirements making it much easier to get higher utilization of your cloud resources directly and via scheduled resource sharing that help drive big costs saving with your cloud spend.

### Ethereum staking from your wallets & private secret managers.

Staking, in fact all of web3 is in fact only one thing, and that thing is the ability to sign & transmit signed messages with your keys. We've decoupled that everything else, the high technical barriers, and high costs, so that it no longer requires you to give up access to your validator keys to participate in staking, taking a step towards making validators, defined by their signing keys decentralized at scale. 

Event driven signature automation for Ethereum staking using our synthetic staking beacon, which bundles middleware like slashing protection and mev into the service which streams validator messages to you on demand to serverless functions, hosted signers, or mobile apps, with the benefit of letting you stake from your wallet without anyone having access to your signing or withdrawal keys and without any infrastructure setup, with only a few lines of code.

### How much will staking services cost for Ethereum?

$10/mo solo or large scale enterprise staking for Ethereum per validator.

### How do I setup validators?

You can use our UI which is in beta, which takes you from 0 -> deployed & serviced validators using Zeus without any coding, technical know-how, you get the picture. You can set it up within 5 minutes, and you have ZERO ongoing maintenance after setup, which is a first of its kind when it compared with other validator services you can get.
